Liver Hepatitis Classification using Deep Learning
This project involves building a deep learning model to classify liver hepatitis from medical image data. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and potentially LSTM layers for temporal or sequence-based analysis.

Overview
The notebook includes:

Image preprocessing and data loading

Neural network model creation using TensorFlow and Keras

Model training and evaluation with standard classification metrics

Visualization of results using ROC curves and confusion matrices

Requirements
Python environment with TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn

Access to a GPU for efficient model training (optional but recommended)

Dataset
Images are expected to be stored in specific directories (e.g., under a Google Drive path). You should organize your data accordingly and update paths in the notebook as needed.

Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter environment.

Mount or link your dataset directory.

Run all cells in sequence to train and evaluate the model.

Results
The output includes performance metrics, classification reports, and visual performance analysis such as ROC curves.
